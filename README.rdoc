== Welcome to Drxfer

Drxfer (or DRXFER, or drxfer, or Dr. Xfer, or just Dr. X) is a Digital Records 
Transfer system, a web application created to allow record owners to transfer
their born-digital records into a dropbox filesystem in accordance with 
pre-existing transfer agreements.

This application was created in 2011 to meet a need at Mount Holyoke College, 
where Archives & Special Collections arranges to receive digital records 
transfers from various departments, offices, and programs. The transferred
records are stored on a file server, from which they will in due course be
retrieved, processed, and delivered to a permanent home for preservation
and access as appropriate.
