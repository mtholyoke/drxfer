== Welcome to Drxfer

Drxfer (or DRXFER, or drxfer, or Dr. Xfer, or just Dr. X) is a Digital Records Transfer system, a web application created to allow record owners to transfer their born-digital records into a dropbox filesystem in accordance with pre-existing transfer agreements.

This application was created in 2011 to meet a need at Mount Holyoke College, where Archives & Special Collections arranges to receive digital records transfers from various departments, offices, and programs. The transferred records are stored on a file server, from which they will in due course be retrieved, processed, and delivered to a permanent home for preservation and access as appropriate.

== Configuration

You will need to create at least the following config files:

* config/database.yml

* config/ldap.yml

* config/environments/production.rb

* config/initializers/notifications.rb

== Operation

The three basic units in the app are Users, Folders, and Agreements, which can be managed though the web UI by admin users.

* *Users* use LDAP for authentication

* *Folders* are where uploads are stored, configured as +transfer_destination_base_path+ in +config/environments/*.rb+

* *Agreements* specify which Users can upload things to which Folders.
